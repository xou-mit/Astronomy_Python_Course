# Coding in Astronomy Workshop Series  
Welcome to the **Coding in Astronomy** workshop series! This repository contains all the materials for the 4-week series organized by the UVA Department of Astronomy.  

Each week focuses on a different topic, and the content is designed to be hands-on and beginner-friendly. You can run the notebooks locally or open them directly in Google Colab (no installation required).
